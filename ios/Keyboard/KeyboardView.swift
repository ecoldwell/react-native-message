/**
 This view is the main view that is used by the extension by
 calling `setup(with:)` in `KeyboardViewController`.
 
 The view will switch over the current keyboard type and add
 the correct keyboard view.
 
 Set `addTextFieldAboveKeyboard` to true to add a text field
 above the demo keyboard. This text field will automatically
 take over as the main proxy instead of the main app.
